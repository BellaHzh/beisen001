# Randomly select two numbers from the list, and compare them, and place the smaller one infront of the larger one.
# Compare a new number with these two individually, and place the smaller one infront of the larger one.
# For example, firstly compare 2 and 4; compare 3 with 2 and 4 respectively. Make the list: 2,3,4
# Follow this step to make a list of numbers from small to large.
# The last one is the largest number on the list.
