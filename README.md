      - e.g. `touch hello.py` to create a new file called `hello.py` in current working directory
    - `open` to open a file
      - e.g. `open hello.py` to open the file called `hello.py` using the default app (can be modified in MacOS by right click on the file --> get info)

- **Git and github 001**
  - Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers who are collaboratively developing source code during software development.
  - basic commands in git: check out [this pdf](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) for basic commands in git (the ones needed for this class are everything on the pdf except for the Branch and Merge part, all assignments are to be submitted on github)
  - A cheat to github: if you want the easy ways, [download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and Familiarize with the User Interface. VSCode allows you to commit and sync in one button click.
