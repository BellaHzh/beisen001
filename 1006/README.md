### Homework 3 Feedback
```
total: 9/10
p1 3/3  
p2 3/3  
p3 3/4  
point deduction: minor error, not counting the cases when year % 4 == 0, year % 100 == 0, and year % 400 != 0 which indicates not a leap year. EXAMPLES: 1900, 2100, 2200 are not leap years but the program identifies them as leap years. 
```
**if fixed before deadline I will add back the points**
