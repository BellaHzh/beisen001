## What we did today
- **Variable**
  - variable types (str, int, float)
  - `type(var)`: returns the type of variable
  - type conversion (`a_string=str(an_int)` and so on)
  - first character cannot be integer
  - case sensitive
- **Print**
  - `print(f"hey {name}")`
  - `print("hey", name)`
  - `print("hey " + name)`
  - `print("Your age is " + age)` throws an error when age is an `int`. Why?
  - üö´ No Chinese comma and quotes!!! (`‚ÄúÔºå‚Äù`)
- **Arithmitic Operations**
  - **Exercise**: What do they mean? Give an example for each
  - `+`
  - `-`
  - `*`
  - `/`
  - `//`
  - `**`
  - `%`
- **Input**
  - syntax: `var=input("prompt goes here")`
  - How to convert?
- **Format**
  ```py
  a = 234.56789
  formatted_a = format(a, '.2f') # leaves two decimal places
  print(formatted_a) #234.56
  ```
  Try this out yourself
  
  ***Reminder: Format turns the float above into str***
- **Error**
  - We briefly went over try catch
  - see src `hello.py` for syntax and use cases
